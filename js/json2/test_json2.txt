How to use?
===========


You can import ``json2`` from ``js.json2`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.json2 import json2
  >>> json2.need()

The most common use case for JSON2 is to patch browsers that don't have this
functionality, typically Internet Explorer pre-version 8. We render the
resource in a conditional comment::

  >>> import fanstatic
  >>> needed = fanstatic.init_needed()
  >>> json2.need()
  >>> print fanstatic.get_needed().render()
  <!--[if lt IE 8]><script type="text/javascript" src="/fanstatic/json2/json2.js"></script><![endif]-->
